This article explains the fundamental concepts behind neural networks and deep learning.</p><h2>What is Deep Learning?</h2><p>Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers to model and understand complex patterns in data. These networks are inspired by the structure and function of the human brain.</p><h2>Neural Network Architecture</h2><p>A neural network consists of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons). Each connection has a weight that determines the strength of the signal passed between neurons. The basic components include:</p><ul><li>Input layer: Receives the data</li><li>Hidden layers: Process the information</li><li>Output layer: Produces the final result</li></ul><h2>How Neural Networks Learn</h2><p>Neural networks learn through a process called backpropagation, where the network adjusts its weights based on the errors in its predictions. This process is repeated many times until the network can make accurate predictions.</p><h2>Common Deep Learning Architectures</h2><h3>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)</h3><p>Specialized for processing grid-like data such as images. CNNs use convolutional layers to detect local features.</p><h3>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)</h3><p>Designed for sequential data like text or time series. RNNs have memory that allows them to remember previous inputs.</p><h3>Transformers</h3><p>The architecture behind modern language models like GPT and BERT.
